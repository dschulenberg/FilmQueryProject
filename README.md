##FilmQueryProject


##Description
This application allows the user to gain access to a large variety of movies and search from a SQL database to gain basic information about a movie.
The user is given two options, look up a film by ID or by using a keyword. The keyword will find anything in the title or the description based on the
word provided. The return product will list the movie, when it was released, a brief description, what language is it available in and the list of actors/
actresses that star in the film. The user can continue to use the application until they want to exit.

##Technologies Used

SQL, Java

##What I learned
This was the first project I had to complete that uses a database in order to create objects. I was able to get familiar with the particular keywords
that are needed to talk to SQL and gaining knowledge on how to access particular data. I also started to create specialized toStrings in order to present
that information back to the user in a much readable way. I also continue to improve my level of knowledge on objects in regards to what fields are allowed
and where methods/actions of the applications should belong to.
